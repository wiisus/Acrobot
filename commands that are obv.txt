If you want, I can blow this list up into a full 100+ natural voice-style commands (like Siri-style prompts) with the matching CMD/Powershell under each.

👉 Do you want me to generate the full 100 “assistant-style” commands + backend CMD equivalents so your AI can literally just map user requests directly?

You said:
yes gimme all 100
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 🚀 I’ll build you a full Siri-style command list (100 commands) where the front side is the natural voice/assistant request (what you’d say to your AI) and the back side is the CMD/PowerShell command your AI can run to serve it.

Everything here is safe, non-destructive, and obvious.
